- My name is Khaled Alrashidi, and I am an aspiring machine learning engineer.

- I'm deeply interested in learning more about artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science. I have worked on several projects such as analyzing international students' mental health and predicting house prices in California.

- Nowadays, the world is filled with tons of data, and I am passionate about leveraging it to benefit both individuals and society at large. 

- Please feel free to explore my work. I would be thrilled to connect with like-minded individuals for feedback, questions, or collaborative projects.

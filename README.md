# Greeting and Introduction
- Welcome! I'm Khaled Alrashidi, a machine learning and data science graduate student at the University of Southern California.

- I'm deeply interested in learning more about artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science. I have worked on several exciting projects such as analyzing international students' mental health and predicting house prices in California.

- Nowadays, the world is filled with tons of data, and I am passionate about leveraging it through ML and DS tools to benefit both individuals and society at large. 

- Please feel free to explore my work. I would be thrilled to connect with like-minded individuals for feedback, questions, or collaborative projects in the same field.
